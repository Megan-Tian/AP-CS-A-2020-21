# AP CS A 2020-2021
AP Computer Science A 2020-2021 programs and projects. My class used Microsoft's TEALS program modelled after the University of Washington's introductory programming class.

## FracCalc

Console-based calculator that handles simple arithmetic operations with two operands. 
TEALS project. 

## TextExcel (will be uploaded when complete)

Simple console-based spreadsheet that can assign text, double, and percent values to a cell. 
Only completes part A, so it can't handle formulas. 
TEALS project.
